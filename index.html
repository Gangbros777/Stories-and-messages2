                        Hi Sarvinoz
                        Hope you're well. Eight days later we went to
                        the New Yourk.Before ye bought the book about
                        "Best places,restaurant and hotel" It was 
                        created 2023 year. 

                        We stayed hotel named "Edison time square". We
                        know this hotel in book (Name in first paragraph)
                        Facts about this hotel
                        Hotel is located in the center of New York.
                        Hotel has 200 rooms.It opened since 1990 year.
                        Our room costs 250$


                        Half day we didn't eat foods in hotel.We went to the Chinees
                        restaurant.It was very good and also local restaurant.
                        When we eat foods, thief came and stole our money.
                        We didn't know that.There is button. Customer press it and 
                        it calls to the police . Thief didn't kill us. They arrested thief.
